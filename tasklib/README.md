# Cornserve Task Library

Built-in unit tasks, execution descriptors, and composite tasks for Cornserve.

Users can customize the `cornserve_tasklib` module by adding new tasks/descriptors or modifying existing ones, install it into their Python environment (e.g., `uv pip install tasklib/`) and deploy it into Cornserve with `cornserve tasklib deploy`.
