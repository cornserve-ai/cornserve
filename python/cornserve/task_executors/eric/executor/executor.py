class ModelExecutor:
    """A class to execute a model with multiple workers.

    This class is instaintiated by the engine, and provides a method to
    trigger the execution of the model with multiple workers.

    Initialization:
    1. A shared memory ring buffer (to broadcast inputs to workers) and a
        response ZMQ socket (to receive signals from workers) are created.
    2. Workers are spawned with a handle to the shared memory ring buffer
        and the address to the response ZMQ socket.
    3. Workers initialize the model and loads pretrained weights.
    4. Workers send a READY signal to the executor.

    Executing a batch:
    1. The executor's `execute_model` method is called with a batch of data.
    2. Data is broadcasted to all workers using the shared memory ring buffer.
    3. Workers receive the data and run inference on the model.
    4. Workers send the results to the Tensor Sidecar with a separate thread.
    5. When results are sent, workers send a DONE signal to the executor.
