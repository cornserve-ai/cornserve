# Getting Started

At a high level, there are two steps to using Cornserve:

1. [**Cornserve deployment**](cornserve.md): Deploying Cornserve on a GPU cluster managed by Kubernetes.
1. [**Building and deploying your app**](app.md): Building a Cornserve app and deploying it on a Cornserve cluster for invocation.
